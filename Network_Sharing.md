## Using Network Sharing
Using network sharing is very simple just make sure the game you want to play is being shared and all the other person has to do is start it up from the network in file exploror.
## Issues
For an unknown reason we were unable to get the network working on calebs computer.  Most Steam games can be shared but there are a few that are unable too, so make sure your game is not one of them.
