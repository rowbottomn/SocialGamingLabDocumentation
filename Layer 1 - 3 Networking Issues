##Layer 1 Networking Issues
Some common Layer 1 problems include the interface is administratively shut down.
On switches, interfaces are up by default, but administrators can manually shut them down. 
It's actually best practice to shut down unused interfaces to stop users from plugging devices in there.
##Layer 2 Networking Issues
Switches are typically considered Layer 2 devices. 
Problems that can occur at this layer include, MAC addressing errors, duplex errors, collisions, CRC frame errors, and spanning-tree problems.
##Layer 3 Networking Issues
Addressing, error handling, congestion control, and packet sequences are performed at this layer.
Routers and Layer 3 switches operate at the network layer. IP, IPX, and AppleTalk are examples of network layer implementations.
Problems that can occur at this layer are network addressing issues and routing issues.
