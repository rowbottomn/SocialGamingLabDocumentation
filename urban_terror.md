## Installing and starting Urban Terror

In your search engine, search "Urban Terror download" and follow the first link it brings up.

There, it will show you a list calles "plan." Click on "Game installer/updater"

To start the download, click on the download link that is compatiable with your system - I recommend using a mirror link because the torrent was bringing up security issues.

The file may be seen as unsafe, click on the file and keep anyways. 
After it has finished installing, extract the zip file.

In the extracted files, click "Quake3-UrT" to start game.

Urban Terror uses QUAKE3 and TCP protocol and its default port is 27960.

## Game settings

For myself, I haven't had to change any control mechanics although many of my peers have rebound controls to better fit their play style.

For game settings, I reccomend increasing the maximum kills per round for longer matches.
