# Alien Swarm
### Server Installation  
Once Alien Swarm is installed, open the library on Steam and change the filter to show tools.  You can install the Alien Swarm dedicated server from the list of tools.
### Client Installation  
Install Steam then install Alien Swarm through Steam.
### Network Protocol  
The dedicated server uses UDP protocol to communicate.
### Server Settings  
The default should work fine.  If you want to change any of the rules or mechanics of the game this is a list of console [commands](https://alienswarm.fandom.com/wiki/Console_commands).
### Client Settings 
 Depending on your play style you might want to adjust them, other than that all the default settings work great.
### Gameplay    
The game is a top-down sci-fi shooter.  On an alien planet, you must survive as long as possible while completing objectives.  You can choose from a variety of player classes, equipment, and weapons.  The game is multiplayer and single-player.
### Issues 
These are a few issues that may appear while setting up the dedicated server.  If you can't find the dedicated server on Steam make sure your library is displaying tools and games.  Make sure that the UDP 27015 port is unblocked and not being used and if so change it to an unused UDP port.  If the dedicated server isn't using the IP address you want, go to network and internet settings, then choose change adapter options, and from there disable any unnecessary IP addresses.  Once Alien Swarm is open if you are unable to find the dedicated server go-to favourites and add the game by looking up the IP address and the port number (example: 192.168.10.1:27015).
