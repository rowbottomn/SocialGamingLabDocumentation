# DOTA 2
### Server Installation  
no external software is required to run a DOTA 2 server
### Client Installation  
client is installed via STEAM store
### Network Protocol  
I was unable to get wire shark data because i could not get another client to join the dedicated server
### Server Settings  
the server settings you use do not affect preformance and only affect gameplay, these settings can be changed to user preferance.

### Client Settings 
for the client settings set the resolution to 1600x900 fullscreen, change the graphics settings to the lowest possible and enable FidelityFX Super Resolution at 70%
### Issues 
currently an unresolves issue where a client cant join the dedicated server.

another unresolves issue where the game will not stert over a network drive.
